# This is the final release version chat software, to install please type "make" into the commandline. For more information look in the INSTALL.txt file.

Welcome!

The chat program provides server and client ends to allow users chat with each other and even play chess games!

To run the server and client, type "make test-all" into the commandline.

A window will pop up, you need to register and login to enter the chat interface.
From there you can add a friend and begin chatting with them.


For this final release the following bonus features are included:

	- Resizeable chat interface
	- Ability to accept/reject non-contact users' invitations.
	- Ability to keep track of all its chat threads.
	- Program provides a graphical user interface.
	- Ability to use Emojis
	- Ability to save a log of each conversation
	- Ability to retrieve chat history of previous connection when switching chat rooms with another user


A missing component here would be the full implimentation of the chess game with another user. The backend of having the chess work with another user is complete the part thats missing is the front end with the gui.

For now the clicking the chess icon will allow a user to play chess with another person locally.
